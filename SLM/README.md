This repository is used for guidance of using the SLM in an ion trap experiment. I'm now dividing the guidance into three parts: (1) preparation for the software; (2) generating the spots; (3) phase jitter concerning. The presentation powerpoint in the GoogleDrive can help you how the SLM works but if you have further questions, feel free to contact shuyun. My email is akashayunshu@gmail.com
