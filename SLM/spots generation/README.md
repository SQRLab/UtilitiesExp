Here I put two files "intensity_generator_v1_final.ipynb" and "intensity_generator_v2_final.ipynb".  
In the file "intensity_generator_v1_final.ipynb", there are some useful functions to generate "blaze grating phase", "sinusoidal grating phase" , "vortex phase" and "spatial filter phase".  
In the file "intensity_generator_v2_final.ipynb", I put the final function "ion_excitatition()" for the pratical experiment use.   
Download the whole folder to make sure everything works well.
